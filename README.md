Minimal static site. Single file: `index.html`.

## Development

- Open `index.html` in a browser to preview.
- Edit the file to update links or copy.

## Deployment

- Hosted via GitHub Pages with a custom domain.
- Keep the `CNAME` file to retain the domain mapping.

## Notes

- Previous Jekyll-based blog has been removed in favor of a simple, fast landing page inspired by danielgross.com.
