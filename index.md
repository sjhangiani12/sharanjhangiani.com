Hi, I'm Sharan. 

I'm a final year undergraduate in the [Information School](https://ischool.uw.edu/) studying Data Science and Computational Finance at the University of Washington. 

_I like thinking and talking about startups, cities, fantasy football, and soccer._

Previously, I worked for [Trueform](https://trueform.io), [SiDx](https://www.sidx.com), [SAP Concur](https://concur.com), and for the [City of Aarhus](https://www.aakb.dk/bibliotek/itk) in Denmark in roles around Software, Machine Learning, and Data. 

I also helped run [DubHacks](https://dubhacks.co), the Algorithmic Trading Club at UW, and helped teach a couple of courses. ([INFO 370](https://myplan.uw.edu/course/#/courses/INFO370) and [INFO 371](https://myplan.uw.edu/course/#/courses/INFO371))

### Currently...
    
Currently, I'm working at [Facebook Marketplace](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/) as a Data Science Intern and reading and talking about books on my podcast, [Nimble Ideas](https://nimbleideas.show).
