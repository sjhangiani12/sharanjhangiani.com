Hi, I'm Sharan. 

I'm a third year undergraduate in the [Information School](https://ischool.uw.edu/) studying Data Science and Computational Finance at the University of Washington. 

_I like thinking and talking about cities, startups, and general tech and economic trends._

Previously, I worked for [Trueform](https://trueform.io), [SAP Concur](https://concur.com), and for the [City of Aarhus](https://www.aakb.dk/bibliotek/itk) in Denmark in roles around Software, Machine Learning, and Data. 

I also helped run [DubHacks](https://dubhacks.co), one of the biggest hackathons in the US, the Algorithmic Trading Club, and helped teach a couple of intro machine learning courses. ([INFO 370](https://myplan.uw.edu/course/#/courses/INFO370) and [INFO 371](https://myplan.uw.edu/course/#/courses/INFO371))

### Currently...
    
Currently, I'm working at [Facebook Marketplace](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/) as a Data Science Intern. 

I'm also building tools for [AI research](mlresearch.tools), reading and talking about books on my podcat, [Nimble Ideas](nimbleideas.show), and creating a community for student entrepreneurs at the University of Washington.

_In between_, I like to listen to podcasts ([my favorites](/my-favorite-podcasts)), follow and play soccer and FIFA, and spend time with friends and family. 

### Say hi!

I love meeting new people. Please, don't be afraid to say hi on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sjhangiani12), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharan.jhangiani), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharanjhangiani/), or via [email](mailto:sharan@uw.edu) to chat or if you want to collaborate on something!
