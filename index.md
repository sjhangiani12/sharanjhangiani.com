Hi, I'm Sharan.


This is old... will update soon if I feel like it...


<!-- I'm a final year undergraduate in the [Information School](https://ischool.uw.edu/) studying Data Science and Computational Finance at the University of Washington.

_I like thinking and talking about startups, urbanism, tech, fantasy football, and soccer._

Previously, I worked for [Trueform](https://trueform.io), [SiDx](https://www.sidx.com), [SAP Concur](https://concur.com), the [City of Aarhus](https://www.aakb.dk/bibliotek/itk) in Denmark, and [Facebook Marketplace](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/) in roles around Software, Machine Learning, and Data.

I also helped run [DubHacks](https://dubhacks.co), the Algorithmic Trading Club at UW, and helped teach a couple of courses. ([INFO 370](https://myplan.uw.edu/course/#/courses/INFO370) and [INFO 371](https://myplan.uw.edu/course/#/courses/INFO371))

### Currently...

Currently, I'm looking for a startup to dedicate my life to, building small side projects, and reading and talking about books on my podcast, [Nimble Ideas](https://nimbleideas.show).

### Say hi!

I love meeting new people. Please, don't be afraid to say hi on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sjhangiani12), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharan.jhangiani), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharanjhangiani/), or via [email](mailto:sharan@uw.edu)! -->
