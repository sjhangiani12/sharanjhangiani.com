Hey, I'm Sharan. 

I'm currently working on a variety of projects, including: Building an app for resellers to manage their inventory, an open source tool to quickly configure payment on APIs, and a few more I can't share quite yet. 

Previously, I was a Machine Learning Engineer at Productiv, where I worked on anything and everything Machine Learning, including but not limited to: training models, data analysis, building our deployment infrastructure, and even building features end-to-end, from ML to front end changes. 

Before that I was a student at the University of Washington where I did a bunch of things, my favorite of which was starting DubHacks Next -- the first incubator for students at UW! You can see all the other things I've done and more details about Next on my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/sharanjhangiani).
