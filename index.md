Hi, I'm Sharan. 

I'm a third year undergraduate in the [Information School](https://ischool.uw.edu/) studying Data Science and Computational Finance at the University of Washington. 

_I like thinking and talking about cities, innovative business models, and building mini tools._

Previously, I worked for the [City of Aarhus](https://www.aakb.dk/bibliotek/itk) in Denmark, [Trueform](https://trueform.io) and [SAP Concur](https://concur.com). 

I also ran [DubHacks](https://dubhacks.co), one of the biggest hackathons in the US, the Algorithmic Trading Club, and helped teach [intro](https://myplan.uw.edu/course/#/courses/INFO370) and [advanced](https://myplan.uw.edu/course/#/courses/INFO371) machine learning. 

This summer, I'll I'll be joining [Facebook](https://facebook.com) in Menlo Park as a Data Science Intern. 

### Currently...

I'm currently working on [Hypothesis](http://hypothesis.fm), a podcast on reverse engineering product decisions.

I'm also working at [SiDx](https://sidx.com/), a rapid blood typing startup, building machine learning infrastructure and pipelines for a future capstone project.

Finally, in my remaining time, I am building projects to support people effected by Covid-19 at [Care37](https://care37.org) with some friends and creating a community for student entrepreneurs at the University of Washington.

_In between_, I like to listen to podcasts ([my favorites](/my-favorite-podcasts)), play soccer and FIFA (let me know if you want to lose to me ðŸ˜‰), and spend time with friends and family. 

### Say hi!

I love meeting new people. Please, don't be afraid to say hi on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sjhangiani12), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharan.jhangiani), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharanjhangiani/), or via [email](mailto:sharan@uw.edu) to chat or if you want to collaborate on something!
