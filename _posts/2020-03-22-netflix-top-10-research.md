_Notes for Hypothesis Episode 0._

### Intro

Hello hello, and welcome to the first ever episode of Hypothesis, a show where we reverse engineer product decisions to try and understand why they were made. I'm Sharan Jhangiani, a student at the University of Washington studying Data Science.

(Arjun): And I'm Arjun Lalwani, a student also at the University of Washington studying Computer Science.

So, this is our first episode, so this will likely never be uploaded, but in the case we do sometime in the far future, full disclaimer; this might be rough, so please bear with us! 

Today we'll be talking about **Netflix** and its newest product offering, **Top 10 List**. 

Let's get started.

### What is Netflix?

As per their website, "Netflix is a streaming service that offers a wide variety of award-winning TV shows, movies, anime, documentaries, and more on thousands of internet-connected devices.

You can watch as much as you want, whenever you want without a single commercial – all for one low monthly price. There's always something new to discover and new TV shows and movies are added every week!"

In short, as many know, Netflix is a multinational streaming platform, providing easy access to TV Shows, Movies, and documentaries, and are known for pretty much completely revolutionizing the way we consume content.

#### History

_I'll switch to bullets here to allow for a more free flowing conversation._

- Netflix was founded in August of 1997 (pre-dot com boom era) by Reed Hastings and less commonly known Marc Randolph. 
- They had met working at Pure Atria, a company started by Reed himself after the small company Marc was at was purchased by them. 
- They got close because they both lived super far away and carpooled to work everyday, an hour long commute. 
- During these commutes, they'd riff on random ideas ranging from "“What's the criteria for something that is going to be successful?” Or “What's a trend that we could leverage?”
- They grew an affinnity for Amazon and spent time brainstorming how to leverage a similar model in a different space (Amazon was just books at this time).
- Decided to experiment with the DVD genre after hearing about the incoming growth.
