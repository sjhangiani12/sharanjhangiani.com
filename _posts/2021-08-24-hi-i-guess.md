Hey. So, I guess this is it... finally blogging. I've kinda wanted to do this for a while, but I really didn't want it to be formal, more so just a place for me to throw ideas and thoughts around whenever I have them.

I recently started a new job (shameless plug but check us out literally so much fun working here productiv.com), and have been learning so freaking much (not sure if I'm cursing on here yet). So, I wanna be able to have a public-ish space where I can throw my learnings each day and save them. This kinda feels like a diary for me, but public? So idk if you're interested in reading this, ya come along.

I really don't expect much out of this other than a place for me to throw thoughts kinda like twitter, so uh ya.

Okay that's all I have, I'm writing a bunch of docs today about our Data Model and things we need to "supercharge" our team with data. (idk why I used that word, cringe).

I'll try and figure out what I can share and share that later today when I'm done.

Okay that's all fr now, bye.
