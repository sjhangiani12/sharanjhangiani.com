## First post from pnt labs

Ayo. This is the first thing ever produced in pnt labs (aka my garage). It's not much, but its something, which is the right step.

Tbh this space feels kinda special to me. I've been working out here pretty consistently for the last month, meditating, and really making this space ~ mine ~. And I kinda love it. There's a creative and inspiring energy being out here, and I can't wait to spend more time out here.

Here's to hoping this space still feels this way for the next few years, and a lot of fun stuff can get built here.
