### An Ode to Doers

I want to preface this essay by quickly explaining the surrounding context in which this is being written. It is currently April 7th, 2020, 1:45AM (PST). The world is under siege by a global pandemic, the biggest and most terrifying phenomenon I have seen in my life (Although, at the _young_ age of 20, there isn't much of a sample size). I am quarantined at home, sitting in my room as I have been for the last almost month now, working on a mix of homework and side projects with the occasional deluge of self-discovery. It is, to say the least, a _very_ interesting time. 

Yet, while there is much to be concerned about, the presiding emotion I have felt these last few weeks has been excitement. To my sister, who I will say is quite is annoyed by my lack of effort to spend time with her, I'm crazy. But to a few of my friends, my feeling is warranted and in fact, mimics their sentiment as well. See, we are, for lack of a better word, _doers_. We like to _build_, and _create_, and just have fun building things for the sake of building things. 

Doers like to just "do" things. They don't care about the circumstance, the time it takes, the effort it requires - they just go for it. There's very little that stands in their way of working on something once they set their minds to it - whether that's monetary, social dissidence, or any alternative sort of pushback, it doesn't matter. And the best part is, they don't do it for the money or the fame or any of that - they do it because it's _fun_. We do it because it's fun. 

### Organizations and People Chasing

The more I think about it, the more I realize -- it is people like these that make me feel like I have a purpose; they give me __energy__ that I seldom have found elsewhere. Maybe this is the naivety of a relatively sheltered 20yr old, but in my current perception, it's true. So, it's easy to come to the conclusion that it is people like these that I want to continue to find, yet finding the ones around me now took 3.5 years, and I don't have that much time to spend. Hence, the problem I face is simple: 

__How do I find the people who inspire me in a timely manner?__


Well, there are two main approaches I've tried to solve this - the generic organizational route and what I'll call the "people chasing" route. 

##### Organizations

I'll get straight to the point -- the organizations I've been exposed to have _not_ done a good job in introducing me to the people I seek. My first week in college began with my joining a professional business frat, marketed to me as an organization filled with people who are doing big and entrepreneurial things, I thought I had hit the jackpot. Yet, while I was able to find some good friends in this organization, I wasn't able to find the people that truly inspired me. And as I mimicked this process across a series of different organizations, I consistently received similar results. Upon reflection, here's why I think this is the case: 

1. Organizations breed structure, and doers don't like structure. This holds them back.
2. Organizations are often large and bureaucratic and often take time to take action. Again, this is against the nature of a doer. 
3. Organizations, especially in the college environment, are often very heavily focused on reputation and brand -- cultivating a group of people focused on their status rather than their output. 
4. Organizations require _time_ commitment, which detracts from the ability to do what one wants when they want.

It's disappointing, to say the least, that the vast majority of organizations on a college campus fail to break beyond the boundaries of these constraints, including entrepreneurship based organizations. 

That all being said, in the brief experience I've had in running various organizations, I have found inklings of success. Specifically, in organizations that are structured around the flexibility to do what the members want to do, are the ones that are successful in aggregating _truly_ inspiring doers. Unfortunately, these often don't last or even exist on college campuses, which is something I'll return to at the end of this essay. 

##### People Chasing

The second method that has resulted in _some_ success for me has been this idea of "people chasing." In a simplistic explanation, it's just pure networking. Starting with one person and then asking him/her to introduce you to another similar person, who introduces you to another, and so forth. It's a long process, but once it's in action, it's quite fruitful. 

I got lucky with my start - I met someone in the line for lunch who helped me kick start the "chase." After that, I was slowly able to meet more and more people. Over time, I feel quite pleased with the group of friends I've built, but I don't want to stop. As mentioned earlier, people inspire me, and I want to keep growing that group that inspires me to get more diverse perspectives and continue growing. Thus, while this system has worked, how do I build something to do this for me. In other words, how do I build a __people pipeline__. 

### Starting Blueprints

If you're looking for a proven and well-defined answer, I'm sorry I don't have one. If you want an unproven crazy idea - well, I've got one of those. 

I mentioned earlier when talking about organizations that there have been inklings of success in attracting doers. I want to revisit that and talk about where that came from.

At the start of this school year, I was given the opportunity to help run the Algorithmic Trading Club. It was a really small club (when I say small I mean like ~5 people every meeting, if even that), so I didn't expect much and thought it'd be a fun way to explore the world of quant finance (side note: I don't really like this world that much haha). Anyways, I was to run it with a good friend of mine, who I'd classify as one of the few doers I've met at UW, and we both decided that because we have this opportunity, we'd try to grow the club. In the first couple of weeks we started off very well: we had things planned out to a T, workshops, speakers, sessions, etc. But a couple weeks into the quarter, everything fizzled out. Demoralized and somewhat disinterested, the next quarter we took a more "hands-off" approach. We reserved the room for the club to meet in and booked a speaker or two, but that was pretty much it. The club moved at the pace and in the direction that the members wanted. _And it went great._ 

Why? Well, we realized that if we want to cultivate a group of people who don't do well with structure and boundaries, establishing an organization with structure and boundaries is just going to push them away. So, we'll take this realization do the opposite -- build an organization without structure. 

What that look like? I don't quite know. Right now, I'm envisioning a space, separate from all the bureaucracy of the university, for makers to just hang out and build together. No rules, no requirements -- full freedom to do whatever you want. Ideally, those who stay and build there are the true doers, and the people that we're looking for. Thus, creating the people pipeline.

I don't really know how this will go, but as I learn, I'll continue to share here. If you have any thoughts on this topic or disagree with something I've said, I'd really love to hear from you.
