title: My Favorite Podcasts
---

After getting asked multiple times what my favorite podcasts are, I decided to compile a running list. I _highly_ reccomend listening to these, and would love to hear opinions.

### Technology:

#### [Acquired](https://www.acquired.fm/)
Hosted by Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal, Acquired was the first podcast that I truly fell in love with. As per their site, "Acquired tells the stories behind great companies, diving deep into the events and strategies that brought them to where they are today.

The show originally started covering "acquisitions that actually went well", examining the reasons behind the rare successful outcomes to understand how we can apply the learnings to our own organizations. As the show grew, we realized every great company -- whether it got acquired, went public, or is still private -- has incredible stories to be told."


#### [Exponent](https://exponent.fm/)
Hosted by Ben Thompson and James Allworth, Exponent is the most dense, but insightful podcast I have found. Each episode is filled with buckets of insight and information, as they connect the dots with you on trends within the tech industry. 

As per their site, "Exponent is a podcast about tech and society." 

### City and Urbanization:

#### [City of the Future](https://sidewalklabs.com/podcast/)
City of the Future is the podcast that solidified my interest in urban development. As per their website, "Each episode explores one idea or innovation that will transform cities." 

If you want to learn about what the future of our cities will look like and think about how we might live, definetly give it a listen.


### Life:

#### [Not Overthinking](https://www.notoverthinking.com/)
Hosted by Ali and Tiamur Abdaal, Not Overthinking is one of my favorite podcasts to just listen to without the intention of getting anything specific out of it, but for the pure purpose of casual entertainment. Often filled with relatable content and an enjoyable, personable, yet at times informative conversation, this is one of my favorite podcasts for passive consumption. 

As defined by their website, "Not Overthinking is a podcast about happiness, creativity, and the human condition." They talk about "things like social interaction, lifestyle design, mental models... Things that are hard to examine, but important to explore. And hopefully, things that make for a fun and interesting chat every week." I highly reccomend this one. 


### Honorable Mentions:

These are podcasts that I sometimes listen to:

#### [Smart Passive Income](https://www.smartpassiveincome.com/listen/)
